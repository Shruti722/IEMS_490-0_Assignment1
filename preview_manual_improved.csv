1,Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?,16,1,"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps and calculate the number of seashells Leigh had.

Step 1: Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the number of seashells Mimi picked up as follows:
2 dozen * 12 seashells/dozen = 24 seashells

Step 2: Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So, we can calculate the number of seashells Kyle found as follows:
2 * 24 seashells = 48 seashells

Step 3: Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. To calculate the number of seashells Leigh had, we can divide the number of seashells Kyle found by 3:
48 seashells / 3 = 16 seashells

2,Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?,19,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cats as 'c'. Since Frankie has six more snakes than cats, the number of snakes is 'c + 6'.
2. Frankie has one less parrot than cats, so the number of parrots is 'c - 1'.
3. We know that six of his pets have four legs. Since dogs have four legs, the remaining pets with four legs must be cats. Therefore, the number of cats is 6.
4. We also know that Frankie has 2 dogs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pets.

- Number of cats: 6
- Number of snakes: 6 + 6 = 12
- Number of parrots: 6 - 1 = 5
- Number of dogs: 2

Total number of pets = 6 + 12 + 5 + 2 = 25

3,"Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?",196,0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Olaf initially has 150 toy cars.

2. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Let's denote the number of toy cars given by the uncle as 'x'. Then, the number of toy cars given by Grandpa is 2x.

3. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Let's denote the number of toy cars given by Mum as 'y'. Then, the number of toy cars given by Dad is y - 5 = 10. Solving for y, we get y = 15.

4. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. We already denoted the number of toy cars given by the uncle as 'x'. Then, the number of toy cars given by Auntie is x + 1 = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

5. Now we know the number of toy cars given by the uncle (x = 5), Grandpa (2x = 10), Dad (y - 5 = 10, so y = 15), and Auntie (x + 1 = 6, so x = 5). We can calculate the total number of toy cars given by Olaf's family.

Total toy cars given by Olaf's family = 5 (uncle) + 10 (Grandpa) + 15 (Dad) + 6 (Auntie) = 36

6. To find the total number of toy cars Olaf has, we add the initial number of toy cars (150) to the total number of toy cars given by Olaf's family (36).

Total toy cars = 150 + 36 = 186

4,"Emma's bank account has $100 in it. Each day of the week, she spends $8. At the end of the week, she goes to the bank and asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her. She leaves the rest in the account. How many dollars remain in the account?",4,1,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Emma spends in a week and then subtract that from her initial account balance.

Emma spends $8 per day for 7 days, so the total amount she spends in a week is:
8 * 7 = 56

Now, let's subtract the amount she spent from her initial account balance:
100 - 56 = 44

At the end of the week, Emma wants to get as many $5 bills as her account can give her. To find out how many $5 bills she can get, we need to divide the remaining balance by 5:
44 / 5 = 8.8

Since Emma can't get a fraction of a bill, she will get 8 $5 bills, which is 8 * 5 = 40 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the amount she got in $5 bills from the remaining balance to find out how much she leaves in her account:
44 - 40 = 4

5,"Ezekiel hikes as a hobby. This past summer, he did a challenging three-day hike across 50 kilometers of wilderness. The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?",15,1,"To find out how many kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day, we need to calculate the distance he covered on the first two days and subtract that from the total distance.

The total distance of the hike is 50 kilometers.

On the first day, Ezekiel covered 10 kilometers.

On the second day, he covered half the full hike distance, which is 50 / 2 = 25 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered on the first two days is 10 + 25 = 35 kilometers.

To find the distance Ezekiel had to hike on the third day, we subtract the distance covered on the first two days from the total distance:

50 - 35 = 15
