2,Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?,19,19,1,"[""Let's break down Frankie's pets step by step.\n\nWe know Frankie has 2 dogs. Since six of his pets have four legs, the remaining pets must not have four legs, which means they are snakes and parrots.\n\nSince Frankie has two dogs with four legs, we subtract 2 from the 6 pets with four legs to find out how many of Frankie's pets are cats or snakes and parrots, which is 6 - 2 = 4.\n\nNow, we are given that Frankie has six more snakes than cats. Let's represent the number of cats as C. Then, the number of snakes is C + 6.\n\nWe also know that Frankie has one less parrot than cats. So, if C represents the number of cats, the number of parrots is C - 1.\n\nSince we have 4 cats or snakes and parrots, we can set up an equation: C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) = 4.\n\nCombine like terms: 3C + 5 = 4.\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides: 3C = -1.\n\nDivide both sides by 3: C = -1/3. However, this doesn't make sense as we can't have a fraction of pets.\n\nLet's re-examine the information. We are told that Frankie has 2 dogs. We also know that six of his pets have four legs. This includes the dogs. So, the remaining pets are cats and parrots.\n\nWe have 2 dogs, so the remaining 4 pets that have four legs must be cats (since snakes don't have four legs). \n\nNow, let's go back to the given information: Frankie has six more snakes than he has cats. Let the number of cats be C. Then, the number of snakes is C + 6.\n\nWe also know that Frankie has one less parrot than cats. So, if C represents the number of cats, the number of parrots is C - 1.\n\nSince we know that the 4 pets that have four legs are cats, we set C = 4.\n\nIf Frankie has 4 cats, he has 4 + 6 = 10 snakes.\n\nAnd if he has 4 cats, he has 4 - 1 = 3 parrots.\n\nThe total number of pets is 2 (dogs) + 10 (snakes) + 3 (parrots) + 4 (cats)."", ""Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1.
